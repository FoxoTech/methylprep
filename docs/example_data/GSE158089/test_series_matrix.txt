!Series_summary	"In development, inducing pluripotency and differentiation into different cell types results in global epigenetic changes, although the extent this occurs in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based neuronal models has not been extensively characterized. We have differentiated iPSCs (33Qn1 cell line) into cortical neurons and assessed their DNA methylation profile at different time points during differentiation and maturation to identify DNA methylomic   trajectories of neuronal aging. Samples were collected at four different time points, these were at the iPSC, neuronal precursor (NPC) and two different terminally differentiated neuronal time points (day 37 and day 58). We have identified loci undergoing significant DNA methylation changes throughout differentiation, have created an epigenetic trajectory signature associated with differentiation/maturation and identified highly connected and influential loci using gene-gene interaction analysis."
!Series_overall_design	"Samples were collected at four different time points during the differentiation and maturation of iPSCs into cortical neurons. Four replicates were collected for each time point apart from the iPSC stage where there are only two replicates."
!Series_type	"Methylation profiling by array"
